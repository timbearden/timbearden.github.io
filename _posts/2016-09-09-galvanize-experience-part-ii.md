This is the second part of a two-part description of my time in Galvanize's Data Science Immersive program. [You can find part one here.]('_posts/2016-09-08-galvanize-experience-part-i.md')

### Week 5
Week 5 was somewhat of a grab-bag of different topics.

We began the week covering web scraping. Python's awesome `BeautifulSoup` package made scraping web sites extremely easy. We also covered some basic HTML and CSS, since that is essential to using BeautifulSoup to scrape data directly from websites.

Web scraping can be a great way to get information, but then how do you store it? Unfortunately, the information that you get may not be standardized in a way that can easily fit the schema of a SQL database. That's where NoSQL databases come into play. We learned about MongoDB and its corresponding python client, `PyMongo`, for this purpose.

On Tuesday we covered topics in natural language processing. This was an interesting day because the instructors tried out a different method, called a 'flipped classroom,' where we did a lot of reading ahead of time, and our class was mostly discussion/talking through a lot of the concepts that we learned in the reading. We learned about using Naive Bayes for classifying documents, and about feature extraction and processing of text documents using concepts like stemming, lemmatization, and tf-idf vectorization.

Wednesday we had our first case study. We split into groups of four, and analyzed a dataset for a ride-sharing service to predict churn.
