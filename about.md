Hey everyone! My name is Tim Bearden, and I am a Data Scientist currently looking for opportunities in the Bay Area. This blog is intended to explore some concepts in statistics and machine learning, and to showcase some of the projects that I work on. You can see the things I've created via the projects link at the top of the page. If you'd like to get in touch, my email, Github, and LinkedIn are all linked at the bottom. Thanks, I hope you enjoy your time here!
